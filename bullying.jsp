<center><p class="head1">We at #Anti-Bully aim to help individuals deal with different types of bullying. So what are the different types of bullying ?</p></center>
<center><div class="title">Verbal Bullying </div></center>
<img width="900px" class="imgteam" src="bullystock2.jpg"/>
<center><p class="head1">Verbal bullying includes using abusive language such as making threats, insults or racist remarks. We usually advise victims to deal with this</p></center>
<center><p class="head1">by ignoring and not responding to such communication as it would encourage the perpetrators to continue abusing them</p></center>
<br>
<center><div class="title">Cyber-Bullying </div></center>
<img width="900px" class="imgteam" src="bullystock3.jpg"/>
<center><p class="head1">Cyber-Bullying is a common tactic employed by bullies to humiliate or embarrass their victims online be it in public or private.</p></center>
<center><p class="head1">This includes:</p></center>
 <center><p class="head1">Transmitting abusive messages, videos or images</p></center>
 <center><p class="head1">Spreading hurtful rumors</p></center>
 <center><p class="head1">Impersonating an individual online or abusing their social media login credentials to do so</p></center>
<br>
<center><div class="title">Physical Bullying </div></center>
<img width="900px" class="imgteam" src="bullystock4.jpg"/>
<center><p class="head1">Physical bullying involves causing deliberate physical harm to a person or inflicting damage onto his or her property.</p></center>
<center><p class="head1">#Anti-Bully often advise victims of this type of bullying to take measures such as ensuring they are in crowded places</p></center>
<center><p class="head1">to reduce the likelihood of being attacked. We also would recommend victims to ensure that they would be escorted by someone they trust</p></center>
<center><p class="head1">such as a teacher or a close friend throughout their day in school.</p></center>
<center><p class="head1">Our personnel at #Anti-Bully advise victims not to respond to these attacks as well as to obtain evidence of such activities and provide them </p></center>
<center><p class="head1">to people of authority such as teachers or the police</p></center>
<br>
<center><div class="title">Social Bullying </div></center>
<img width="900px" class="imgteam" src="bullystock5.jpg"/>

<center><p class="head1">Social bullying is one of the types of bullying which would be more challenging to notice as it is often carried out unbeknownst to the victim</p></center>
<center><p class="head1">It is often used to humiliate or degrade a victim's reputation through: </p></center>
<center><p class="head1">Spreading malicious rumors</p></center>
<center><p class="head1">Discouraging people from interacting with victims</p></center>
<center><p class="head1">Making embarrassing or humiliating jokes at the expens of the victim</p></center>
